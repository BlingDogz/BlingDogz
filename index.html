          BlingDogz 5-Year Plan </p>
        <p>
          Over the next five years, we will engage our community in a range of events, including a series of BlingDogz NFT releases. Each release will become increasingly rare, with fewer NFTs being minted each time.
          <br><br>
          There will never be more than 10,000 BlingDogz NFTs in existence. <br>The later the release, the more rare the BlingDogz NFT!
